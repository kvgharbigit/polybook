```

**Tasks:**
- [x] Initialize Expo managed workflow project structure
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create monorepo structure with shared package

4. **Performance focus**: Continuous monitoring of memory and speed
5. **User feedback integration**: Early user testing for UX validation

### Technology Decisions

#### Core Stack
- **React Native + Expo**: Maximum code reuse, rapid iteration
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **WatermelonDB**: Offline-first database with sync capabilities
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Supabase**: Minimal backend infrastructure

#### Language Processing
- **Bergamot/Marian**: Open-source neural machine translation
- **FreeDict/Wiktionary**: Open-source dictionary data
